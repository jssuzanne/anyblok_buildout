Anyblok Buildout Recipe
=======================

This is a buildout recipe for `Anyblok`_

The main goal of this recipe is to help you in : 

* Bootstrapping a new `Anyblok`_ directories layout to start a new project
* Install all required dependencies in an isolated environment that does not mess up your main python path

.. _anyblok: https://bitbucket.org/jssuzanne/anyblok

System dependencies
-------------------

Anyblok needs at least python 3.

You'll also need the python3-dev package in order to compile some dependencies
For example on debian based system (replace X by appropriate version)

    sudo apt-get install python3.X-dev 

Anyblok use Postgresql and through SqlAlchemy

    sudo apt-get install postgresql

Installation
------------

Once you're done with system dependencies it's as easy as this :

Make a new virtualenv 

    pyvenv-3.3 anyblok_demo

Go into the new virtualenv and activate it

    cd anyblok_demo
    source ./bin/activate

Create a directory to store your project and change into it

    mkdir projects
    cd projects

Clone the current repository and give it your project name

    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/jssuzanne/anyblok_buildout demo

Change to the project directory, bootstrap and build it

    cd demo
    ../bin/python3.3 bootstrap.py

Launch the buildout. Beware of launching it from the new bin directory created by the previous command

    ./bin/buildout

Your environment is ready, You're done!

What has happened here ?
========================
The ./bin/buildout command as automatically get and install all the required dependencies using the buildout.cfg file.
Look at buildout.cfg file to understand deeply the Anyblok ecosystem.

How to run the whole stuff ?
============================

The buildout comes with a small Anyblok example. You can delete it to create your own.
By the way if you want to try the demo, here are the steps to follow.

* Create a new database

    createdb demo

* Edit the anyblok.cfg file according to your database settings
* Run the server

    ./bin/anyblok_wsgi -c anyblok.cfg

* Depending on how you edit the anyblok.cfg, launch a browser and go to the right url and port. Default is :
    
    http://localhost:8080

You'll see a POC page with some polymer web components.

To go further with the example, you can install the `exampleblok` and will automatically create you database tables and populate some fixtures.
Look at the `doc` directory of the main Anyblok respository for more details.
